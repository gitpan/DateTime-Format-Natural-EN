NAME
    DateTime::Format::Natural::EN - Create machine readable date/time with
    natural parsing logic

SYNOPSIS
     use DateTime::Format::Natural::EN;
 
     $parse = DateTime::Format::Natural::EN->new();
 
     $dt = $parse->parse_datetime($date_string);

DESCRIPTION
    "DateTime::Format::Natural::EN" consists of a method,
    "parse_datetime()", which takes a string with a human readable date/time
    and creates a machine readable one by applying natural parsing logic.

FUNCTIONS
  new
    Creates a new DateTime::Format::Natural::EN object.

  parse_datetime
    Creates a "DateTime" object from a human readable date/time string.

     $dt = $parse->parse_datetime($date_string);

     $dt = $parse->parse_datetime(string => $date_string, debug => 1);

    The options may contain the keys 'string' and 'debug'. Former one may
    consist of the datestring, whereas latter one holds the boolean value
    for the debugging option. If debugging is enabled, each token that is
    analysed will be output to stdout with a trailing newline.

    Returns a "DateTime" object.

  format_datetime
    Not implemented yet.
